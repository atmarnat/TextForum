A testing area for various parts of the project. May not directly associate with the main project. This will probably be removed as I get further along in the project. It is mainly to help me learn various things about ASP.NET and the MVC

Currently there are 3 parts.
1. Part 1: MessageBoard
This is a simple test for the models and a controller, to see if I could get the posts to work, currently expanding on this.
1. Part 2: MessageBoardDB
This implemented a local database that I could pull values from
1. Part 3: Sandbox
Currently not working on this part, it was used to learn HTML, CSS, and some JS. I will cannibalize parts of this for the different styles I want to use, as the layout is exactly how I want it. It will be optimized in the MessageBoard, probably by cutting most of this out and going down to partial views.
